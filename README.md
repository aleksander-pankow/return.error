Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile, it's great to meet you here! 😊


## 🚀 About Me
In the past two years, my focus has been on iOS development, where I have dedicated my efforts to becoming a proficient and versatile developer. Although my experience in this field has been predominantly non-commercial, I have consistently demonstrated a strong aptitude for iOS app development and a deep understanding of its principles.

I have rich experience in project management, internet marketing and promotion.

⚡️ My total experience in IT is over 10 years.
